# About this project
Hello!

I am learning how to use Git. This is a testing directory for learning how to commmit, track changes, and manage push/pull requests.

# Learning Notes

I have copied an index.html file into this repository and created a new branch called `gh-pages`. I have also manually set the default branch in GitHub from `master` to `gh-pages`. This allows me to serve a static landing html page to serve as a mini website by going to `https://username.github.io/repositoryname`. For me this is <https://davidcurie.github.io/hello-world>.

Be sure to also copy in a css file if you want to spice up your plain html.
